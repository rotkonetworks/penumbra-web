/**
 * Per-bucket bonded-stake snapshots + delegation/undelegation flows, with the
 * top validators that drove each bucket's flow.
 *
 * Buckets are `stepDays` wide. With stepDays=1 each row is a calendar day;
 * larger steps aggregate flows and sparsen the stake snapshots to keep the
 * cost manageable for long windows. The chart picks step values such that
 * every window stays in the 25–200 point range — fine enough that the line
 * still reads as continuous, coarse enough that the per-validator LATERAL
 * lookup count stays sane (90K lookups at daily/2y was timing out >60s).
 *
 * Active stake here = sum of supply_total_staked.um for validators that are
 * *currently* in the ACTIVE state. Pindexer's stake_validator_set table only
 * holds the latest validator state (no per-height history), so we make the
 * defensible approximation that membership in the active set has been stable
 * over the chart window. For 30–90 day windows this is mostly true on
 * Penumbra mainnet — validator churn is slow.
 *
 * supply_total_staked only writes a row when a validator's stake changes,
 * so for any given bucket many validators have no row at all. The stake
 * query must therefore carry forward each validator's last known um value
 * rather than reading the bucket's rows directly — otherwise quiet buckets
 * collapse to near-zero and the chart looks broken.
