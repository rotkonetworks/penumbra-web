/**
 * Resolves a fresh ephemeral Penumbra address for inbound deposits.
 *
 * `ephemeralAddress` (vs `addressByIndex`) is critical: each deposit lands at
 * a one-shot bech32 the source chain has never seen, so Coinbase / Noble /
 * Skip route partners can't link two deposits to the same sub-account. We
 * pre-fill this into the Skip widget's `connectedAddresses` so the user
 * never has to copy or paste an address.
 *
 * The query rotates whenever its key changes — reopen the dialog after the
 * staleTime window and you get a brand new address.
