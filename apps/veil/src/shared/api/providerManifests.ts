/**
 * Resolves all installed wallet provider manifests, **dropping any that fail**
 * to fetch. Previously this used `Promise.all`, so one misbehaving extension
 * — e.g. Prax injecting a stale `chrome-extension://invalid/manifest.json`
 * after an uninstall, or any Penumbra-fork extension whose content script
 * doesn't get its runtime id bridged in time — would reject the whole batch
 * and the user would see an empty wallet list, even with a working wallet
 * (Zafu, Prax) installed.
 *
 * `allSettled` lets healthy providers surface while we silently skip broken
 * ones. The connect button reads from this; if every provider fails, the
 * caller sees an empty record (treated the same as "no wallet installed").
